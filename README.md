# Solana Mobile dApp Scaffold

A ready-to-go template Solana React Native dApp with dependencies installed and basic React UI components.
It provides an interface to connect to locally installed wallet apps (that are MWA-compatible), view your account balance on devnet, and request an airdrop of SOL.

This React Native dApp is only fully functional on Android.

## Featured Libarires
- [Mobile Wallet Adapter](https://github.com/solana-mobile/mobile-wallet-adapter/tree/main/js/packages/mobile-wallet-adapter-protocol) for connecting to wallets and signing transactions/messages
- [web3.js](https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/) for constructing transactions and an RPC `connection` client.

## Prerequisites

If you haven't setup a React Native development environment for Android, you'll need to do that first. Follow the [Prerequisite Setup Guide](https://docs.solanamobile.com/getting-started/development-setup).

Follow the guide to make sure you:
- setup your Android and React Native development environment.
- have an Android device or emulator.
- install an MWA compliant wallet app on your device/emulator.
   
## Usage
1. Initialize project template
```
npx react-native init MySolanaDapp --template @solana-mobile/solana-mobile-dapp-scaffold --npm
```
2. Install dependencies
- `yarn install` or `npm install`
3. Launch the app on your Android device/emulator
- `npx react-native run-android`

## Troubleshooting
  
- `TypeError: cli.init is not a function` 
  - This during template initialization means you have an old version of React Native CLI.
This template only works with the new CLI. You can uninstall and reinstall it as directed [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72768245/typeerror-cli-init-is-not-a-function-for-react-native).

<br>

- `error Failed to load configuration of your project.`
  - Same as above, but for `yarn`. [Uninstall and reinstall](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli#updating-the-cli) the CLI through yarn.

<br>

- `Looks like your iOS environment is not properly set`:
  -  You can ignore this during template initialization and build the Android app as normal. This template is only compatible with Android.

<br>

- `Usage Error: It seems you are trying to add a package using a https:... url; we now require package names to be explicitly specified.`
  - This error happens on certain versions of `yarn`, and occurs if you try to initialize the template through the Github repo URL, rather than the npm package. To avoid this, use the `@solana-mobile/solana-mobile-dapp-scaffold` package as specified, or downgrade your `yarn` version to classic (1.22.x).

<br>

- `error Couldn't find the ".../@solana-mobile/solana-mobile-dapp-scaffold/template.config.js file inside "@solana-mobile/solana-mobile-dapp-scaffold" template.`
  - This is a [known error](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/issues/1924) that occurs with certain versions of `yarn` (>= 3.5.0). It is fixed by running the cli command with the `--npm` flag or downgrading your version of `yarn`.
